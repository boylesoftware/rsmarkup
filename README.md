# X2 Framework for Node.js | Result Set Parser

RSParser is a Node.js module that parses SQL query result sets that have been structured and marked in a special way into complex JSON data structures. It also supports merging results of multiple SQL queries into a single result tree to allow multi-branch hierarchical data structures that include collection properties on the same nesting level.
